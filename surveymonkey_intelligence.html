    <h2 class = "proj-title">Redesigning our starter plan and pricing page</h2>
    <p>  </p>
    <p> One of my goals was to improve the conversion of our paid plans, mainly the Starter Plan. Our free to paid account conversion rate was lower than the industry average. I had two hypotheses on the issue</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Users were confused about what they were buying. There wasn't a clear grouping of reports for our Free, Starter, Professional, and Ultimate plans. There was no narrative on what each plan was for. </li>
      <li> Users were getting too much value from the Free plan. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> My process involved getting buy in from our team that we needed to redesign the plans so that it clearly communicates the value of each plan. I analyzed our usage data to identify which reports to adjust and also sent a few mockups of how the new pricing page would look like. Ultimately, we decided to move the one off usage and demographic reports from the free plan to the starter plan. Our new pricing page had a clear green triangle shape that identified which reports fall under which plans, and a simple "Everything You Need to Benchmark Your App" </p>

    <p class = "gal-header gal-head-color"> Comparing New Tangible Interfaces</p> 
    <p style = "margin-top: 25px">
      Are there inherent differences between using paint and paper versus digital projection and display systems? To answer this question, I study and compare the 
      <a href src="http://hlt.media.mit.edu/?p=2286">Dandelion Painting</a>
      <a href src = "http://hlt.media.mit.edu/?p=27">Living Wall</a>, 
      <a href src="http://www.melaniecrean.com/interactivity2011/?p=303">Traveler's Insurance</a>, and <a href src="http://imagebeat.com/index.php?id=13">Plasma Poster</a> interfaces.
      I start with an overview of the four interfaces, analyze them according to different cateogires such as discoverability, and then end with a few concluding thoughts.</p> 
  </div>
  <div class = "supplement row-fluid">
    
  <h2> PAINT INTERFACES</h2>
  
  <p>Traditional paintings provide a one way communication between the author and the viewer. The painting cannot respond to the viewer’s interactions or queries. A new type of interface I recently discovered called programmable paint changes this. By embedding microcontrollers and sensors, programming paint allows the author to provide a richer experience in a lvling space.  </p>

  <div class = "span6 video-description">
    <p class = "bdyem"> The Dandelion Painting - MIT Media Lab </p>
    <p>The Dandelion Painting is an interactive and programmable painting created by the High Low Tech group. When a viewer blows on the flower, this initiates the story of how a white flower spreads its seeds across the plains using a mix of traditional drawing tools such as rice paper and paint and electronics such as microcontrollers (Arduino) and LEDs as programmable strokes. At the end of the piece, we see the researchers reveal the circuitry behind the painting. </p>

    <p class = "bdyem"> The Living Wall - MIT Media Lab</p>
    <p>The Living Wall is composed of paper and paint. It monitors the environment using touch sensors and microcontrollers and provides feedback through LED lights and sounds when the user interacts with the system.</p>

  <h2> DIGITAL INTERFACES</h2>
  
<p> Digital projection systems and digital displays are becoming more ubiquitous. They allow designers to provide dynamic interactions for their intended users.
</p>

<div class = "span6 video-description">
    <p class = "bdyem"> The Traveler's Insurance - Monster Media</p>
    <p>Traveler's Insurance is an advertising piece created by Monster Media using a high end projection system that allows for real-time interactivity and interaction. The video shows multiple interactive bright red umbrellas (the logo for Traveler’s Insurance) in a corridor within an airport. This is a highly targeted advertising campaign for Traveler’s Insurance as they can reach people most in need of Traveler’s Insurance. </p>
  </div>

    <p class = "bdyem"> Plasma Poster - FX Palo Alto Laboratory</p>
    <p>Lastly the Plasma Poster is a poster-sized touchscreen placed in a public area for communal use by groups of researchers. When there is no user input, the touchscreen cycles through different types of social media content. During the user input, the user can interact with the rest of the web world. </p>
  </div>



  </div>

  <div class = "supplement row-fluid">
    <h2> EMOTION AND REACTION </h2>
    <p>
  Paint is slow and inflexible whereas digital displays tend to be fast and flashy. The leaves on the Traveler’s Insurance logo jumps quickly during an interaction. Paint cannot be easily reshaped. Unlike digital projections or digital displays, a painting is still. When you view a painting, it can be calming. We don’t expect new images to suddenly flash in. The Dandelion Painting is especially so since it depicts a scene from nature. When I watch the Dandelion Painting, I feel relaxed and at ease. The Plasma Poster constantly provides social media updates in their timelines.  The Plasma Poster makes me feel anxious. Do I need to answer a query? Should I look something up? </p>
  

  <p>The affordances of paint and digital displays are for viewing and to an extent touching. Paint supports the expressions of ideas and content narration. A painting asks the user to first watch, think and reflect about the story it is trying to tell. At the same time the canvas limits the artist’s ability to tell a story. You have only one canvas to work off of, so you need to be thoughtful in how much you want to communicate. The Dandelion Painting tells a simple story of how flowers spread and grow. Digital displays on the other hand offer the designer many pages of dynamic storytelling and communication capabilities. The digital display medium is great for tasks that relate to status updates and constant message communication. The Plasma Poster for example tells a daily story of the new progress of the researchers.</p>
  <p>
    Paint is also very inflexible. You cannot erase paint. Since paint is hard to remove, the artist needs to be very considerate about the location of their piece over a long period of time. The Living Wall displays flowers and light bulbs. This is appropriate for many types of audiences. You can place it at home or a café or other public areas. However if you provide a more provocative message, then it limits your audience. For example, if a space is used by children during a portion of a day, then you wouldn’t want to paint it in the space since the children will be exposed to it. A Living Wall painting therefore is telling about the community that uses the space and what’s “acceptable” by the community. </p>
    <p>One of the benefits of a digital display is its flexibility. You can easily change the message for what’s appropriate for the audience at any point in time. The airport for example can shift in new advertising messages during every hour if it believes it will maximize profits best. If the airport used a Living Wall as the medium for its advertising space, it would be difficult for the airport to sell the advertising space on a daily basis. </p>

  </div>
  <div class = "supplement row-fluid">
  <h2> DISCOVERABILITY AND INTERACTION </h2>
<p>  How do you hit the “start” button for these pieces? </p>
<p>
The Traveler’s Insurance is simple. Walking by the system can easily activate the system. Since so many people walk by the area it is easily activated. By placing a row of these ads in sequence, when people watch other people playing with it, we can see it attract a larger audience to engage the system.  
</p>
<p>
What about initiating other interactions? The seeds on the Dandelion Painting are activated by a user blowing on the LED light, but this may be challenging to discover. There is no visible clue for the user to make this connection. How can the researchers help the user discover that they can blow on the petals? The designers could make all the flowers blink to attract the user’s attention, and then educate the user about this interaction by having one flower’s petals flutter before having the seeds spread and cycle through this. </p>
<p>
This brings up a larger question that is beyond the scope of this paper that I’d like to highlight. How do we help users discover new gesture interactions? Even “click” interactions can be hard for some users to discover. Today there are many touch interactions – 3 finger pinch, swipe, tap, etc that a designer can include, but may be very hard for a user to find as many of the gestures are not standardized across platforms.</p>

   <h2> FINAL THOUGHTS AND SYNOPSIS </h2>
   <p>
  Programming paintings and digital displays offer different capabilities for the designer and experiences for the user. I find that I really enjoy the experience of the programmable paint pieces whereas I like the utility of digital displays.</p>

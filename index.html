      <p>
        I'm an experienced product leader and a career coach with a strong customer focus and technical knowledge. Recently I worked as Director of Product at Smartsheet leading teams to reimagine our creation experiences. I've had 10 years of experience delivering product growth, launching SaaS and B2C solutions, and driving revenue and user engagement. I've also worked at Twitch, SurveyMonkey and Microsoft.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a coach, I help product managers grow into senior roles and support professionals transitioning into product management. I draw on my product leadership and AI expertise to help clients upskill and advance, but my broader mission is to help them create a career and a life that feels balanced and joyful.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the perspective of a working parent and strong financial savvy, I guide clients in building not just career momentum but also peace of mind and financial freedom, so they can focus on what truly matters.

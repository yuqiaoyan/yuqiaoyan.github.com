    <h2 class = "proj-title"> Why create safewalk? </h2>
    <p>During a trip to San Francisco, I was ambushed and robbed near the Blue Bottle cafe by Union Square. When I spoke to the police, they informed me that crime rates had been rising. <a href = "http://www.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/sf-sees-highest-crime-rate-since-2008/Content?oid=2636673"> SF Examiner reports </a> that there's been a double-digit jump in thefts and robberies. The police mentioned it was especially bad by 3rd and Mission. Everything before that "line" was ok, but once you past the line that where travelers run into trouble. Unfortunately I was new to the area, and I wasn't aware.</p>
    <p>Checking crime information is not part of people’s everyday workflow. Popular mapping apps like Google Maps recommend map routes to optimize for SPEED of getting from point A to point B. Waze, recently acquired by Google, provide real time traffic reports like “Police” but rather than raise awareness of police crime reports the “Police” feature helps users evade cops and avoid traffic tickets.</p> 
    <p>Other apps like <a href= "http://sanfrancisco.crimespotting.org/map/">crimespotting</a> attempt to raise awareness of crimes in an area by providing a mapping visualization. This is not a great solution in a scenario when users need to be able to quickly look for directions on the go. Crimespotting data is too high level and doesn't recognize data based on your location so you can easily assess your situation. Using crimespotting, users need to carefully inspect and consume the map information which most users will not do.  </p>

    <div class="img_wrapper">
    <img src ="img/gal/safewalk_crimespotting.png" alt="crimespotting" class = "center-img">
  </div>

    <emphasis>No mapping application incorporates crime data to recommend routes that are FAST and SAFE for citizens. By integrating crime data into the route recommendation and making it part of a user's normal process flow in determining what path to take to their next location, we can eliminate speed bumps that will help users understand the safety of their route. I built Safewalk so people traveling to new areas or looking to move to a new location can be made aware of the safety of the area.</emphasis>
